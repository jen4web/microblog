         	<p>I&rsquo;ve taught for 20 years in academia.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a teaching assistant, an adjunct instructor, a lecturer with benefits, and a program director.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve taught courses with syllabi developed by others. I&rsquo;ve developed my own syllabi for courses with objectives and nothing else. I&rsquo;ve identified and created my own courses from nothing to fit inside of a degree program. I&rsquo;ve created the entire degree program.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve mentored maybe 200 students over the course of this time through some type of capstone or thesis project. These are the big projects that students create at the end of their degree program that synthesize everything they&rsquo;ve learned into a portfolio-worthy project. Most of my mentees were graduate students.</p>

<p>Some of those students had a clear vision of what they wanted in life. Others went to grad school to &ldquo;learn more about computers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When it came time for capstone, everything changed. The style of teaching, the expectations of students and instructors, the work, the overwhelm, the self-doubt, and the joy of completion were always part of the journey.</p>

<p>Over the next several posts, I will identify a few common themes that ran through nearly every capston project I advised. We&rsquo;ll start here, with one of my favorite capstone cartoons. Every student experienced this somewhere along the way.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>It&rsquo;s in Squarespace, Wix, Microblog, WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Softr, Gumroad, Teachable, Thinkific, and countless others.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s usually located under Design, Theme, or Advanced.</p>

<p>It looks like this:
<img src="uploads/2021/63556fea15.png" width="447" height="600" alt="The Box." /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s The Box.</p>

<p>Into this box, one pastes CSS.</p>

<p>This implies that the website owner:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>knows enough CSS to know what to do with this box</p></li>

<li><p>can form a CSS selector that &ldquo;works&rdquo; (i.e. specific enough to the problem but not overly specific)</p></li>

<li><p>knows enough CSS properties to spell out the styling that they want</p></li>

<li><p>understand the cascade enough to know how to make their style work when it doesn&rsquo;t</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Wow. So why is there so much code in no-code site builders?</p>

<p>True, you don&rsquo;t have to use the box. But if you use no-code tools long enough, you&rsquo;ll eventually find something that you&rsquo;d like to tweak just a little bit relative to what you&rsquo;re able to customize with the tools.</p>

<p>Where does one go to learn this CSS? The professional courses are all focused on layers of command-line tools, over-powered code editors, and Git repositories. None of these things help with The Box.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the browser&rsquo;s devtools are pretty inpenetrable to those who don&rsquo;t know HTML and CSS already.</p>

<p>In the short term, we must teach CSS to navigate The Box. (And let&rsquo;s face it, many of today&rsquo;s &ldquo;full stack&rdquo; coders aren&rsquo;t able to navigate it, either.)</p>

<p>In the long term, we need to improve our interfaces in some way so The Box isn&rsquo;t needed.</p>

<p>This is a big problem to solve that no one is talking about.</p>

         	<p>I keep waiting for the day when higher ed discovers <a href="https://www.wired.com/2004/10/tail/">The Long Tail</a>.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, if you wanted a master&rsquo;s degree, you went to whatever university was nearby. You paid in-state tuition, if applicable. You kept your job and went to school in person at night.</p>

<p>Today, if you want a master&rsquo;s degree, you have many more choices for degrees. Many offer a 100% online option, or &ldquo;zero residency.&rdquo; Some have low residency &ndash; part of a class in person, or a whole class in person in a compressed timeline. The idea is that you do your residency while taking a vacation from your job, if needed. But pretty much you can go to any school you want, on any timeline you want (full time or part time) and get the degree you want.</p>

<p>What is the difference between a MSCS at UMass, UVA, UMN, or UCLA? Why would I pick one school over the other?</p>

<p>You can say it&rsquo;s all about the faculty, the location, the school&rsquo;s reputation, the specific courses. These elements certainly drive many choices.</p>

<p>But truthfully, it comes down to price. It&rsquo;s a MSCS. Everyone offers one of these. They aren&rsquo;t all that different. To attract students, you have to drop your price. This leads to a spiral to the bottom.</p>

<p>Instead, universities could be offering The Ultimate Degree In This Obscure Subject. Who offers the ultimate Digital Storytelling degree? The Web Development degree?</p>

<p>The usual objection has to do with faculty. But since we&rsquo;re teaching under a majority-adjunct faculty model already, is this really an objection?</p>

<p>Great advice on how to lay out a home page, but so many people get hung up on the design details.</p>

<p>In about 30 minutes, I built out a template based on his description in his article: <a href="https://storybrand.softr.io/">https://storybrand.softr.io/</a></p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s a breeze to jump in and make changes with Softr, even if you don&rsquo;t know the software.</p>

<p>This is an example of transferrance, one of the largest challenges in teaching technology. Miller wrote an amazing article with text descriptions of what the website should include. Softr has a great tool that reflects all of those descriptions. But putting these two things together is a bit more difficult for many people. By providing an example like this, the concepts become more tangible to learners.</p>

         	<p>Folk music seems to rotate in recent history.</p>

<p>It was a big thing in the 60s, of course. The singer/songwriter with acoustic guitar singing protest songs was everywhere &ndash; Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Jonie Mitchell, Pete Seegar, Simon and Garfunkel, Peter Paul and Mary.</p>

<p>It made a comeback in the 90s in the form of the Indigo Girls, Tracy Chapman, Suzanne Vega, Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris, Michelle Shocked, and Christine Lavin. Notice these are all women - there weren&rsquo;t many men doing this.</p>

<p>We got a little bit in the 2010s with Nickel Creek, Chris Thile, and Heather Nova.</p>

<p>Why not sea shanties as a foundation going into the 2020s?</p>

<p>My friend and colleague <a href="https://www.marymalloy.net">Mary Malloy</a> was on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/16/957593535/why-sea-shanties-have-taken-over-tiktok">NPR talking about sea shanties</a>.

<p>As a longtime musician, I&rsquo;ve been fascinated watching sea shanties take over the internet this past week.</p>

<p>Playing or singing music with others is always a great joy. It is one of the hardest parts of this pandemic, missing my fellow musicians for weekly practice.</p>

<p>This music taking over TikTok at this moment in time has several interesting threads.</p>

<p>a. Sea shanties aren&rsquo;t difficult to sing. They have pleasant, simple melodies. They&rsquo;re easily harmonized.</p>

<p>b. Thre are fantastic stories behind the songs. Some compare isolation on board ships with isolation in pandemic times. These stories are also very different than the usual run-of-the-mill pop song lyrics (seriously, how much can we sing about love and loss anyway?).</p>

<p>c. No music training or instruments are required to participate. (Although in the latest versions, we have instruments added, including a beat track!)</p>

<p>d. And this is critical &ndash; TikTok made it happen, because they allow EASY layering of your video on top of others. No Garage Band, no special software, just a free app with amazing usability.</p>

<p>Now someone with no music training and few technical skills can join in the fun, creating something bigger than themselves with people they don&rsquo;t know in a time of isolation. What could possibly be more appropriate to this moment in history?</p>

         	<p><a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/modern-spacer-gif/">Why not bring back spacer GIFs?</a></p>

<p>Josh advocates for a new separation of concerns, based on compartmentalized technologies (buttons, lists, etc) as opposed to HTML, CSS, JavaScript.</p>

<p>Amusingly, the problem he describes would be fixed with some simple CSS, an understanding of the cascade and inheritance, and an hour or so figuring out how margins really work.</p>

<p>Just like Josh doesn&rsquo;t understand CSS, not everyone understands JavaScript. It takes a lot of learning to get good at JavaScript. And shockingly, the same is true for CSS.</p>

<p><strong>If you want to have CSS experts who can fix your problems, you can&rsquo;t put the CSS in your JavaScript.</strong></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s separation of concerns, old-school style: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why Josh&rsquo;s proposed separation of concerns, based on components (button, list, media) flat out doesn&rsquo;t work. This separation of concerns relies on a front-end expert who can keep up with three different and rapidly evolving technologies. It doesn&rsquo;t allow for expertise in any one area.</p>

<p>Thus, you wind up with a JavaScript expert who doesn&rsquo;t understand CSS and wonders why no one else (in his sphere) does either.</p>

<p>I am amused that the ultimate solution to Josh&rsquo;s problem is to go with the old-school separation of concerns and talking to a CSS expert, rather than attempting to bend the web to his will using JavaScript alone.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Two approaches to teaching tech:</p>

<p>a. Teach the button-clicking in the tool</p>

<p>b. Teach problem-solving across tools</p>

<p>You need both to do well.</p>

<p>Obviously A is where the technology product thrives &ndash; these are the help files. This is also where lots of YouTube videos and commercial video (like LinkedIn Learning) tends to thrive. Teach me how to use this software, rather than teach me how to solve this problem.</p>

<p>A is also the technology bootcamps. Yes, they might teach JavaScript, but they&rsquo;re really teaching copy/paste concepts. They are not thinking about big hairy problems and how to attack them.</p>

<p>B is much more difficult because it involves critical thinking, and sometimes your favorite tool isn&rsquo;t the answer. This is of little interest to software manufacturers, because it&rsquo;s rare that the software addresses a problem completely. (When it does, sometimes you&rsquo;ll see this technique used.)</p>

<p>B tends to be where higher ed thrives. Without the economic necessity of talking about specific software packages, higher ed can talk about problems instead: how to think about problems, frameworks for addressing problems, identifying and evaluating potential solutions. Implementing those solutions tends to be assumed that you&rsquo;ll learn on your own, at least at the graduate level. Some button-clicking courses happen at the undergrad level.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s very little B happening in the tech bootcamps. Bootcamps are more concerned that students know how to copy/paste JavaScript and debug. They aren&rsquo;t concerned that students can think through a problem, identify a solution, and craft JavaScript to address it.</p>

<p>Some careers specialize in A, some in B. But you need both sides of this teaching to do well and to advance in your career.</p>

         	<p>My <a href="https://www.jenkramer.org">JenKramer.org</a> website has been embarrassing for years now.</p>

<p>I have finally redesigned it in <a href="https://www.softr.io">Softr</a>.</p>

<p>Why Softr? I don&rsquo;t need a site builder for my own websites.</p>

<p>Even though my previous site was built with just HTML, CSS, and PHP includes, it was still annoying to update. Weeding through the code just to find the text I wanted was an extra level of thought that, honestly, wasn&rsquo;t required.</p>

<p>A redesign was overwhelming to think about. Beyond color schemes, fonts, photos, and content, there are infinite ways to manage the layout.</p>

<p>Softr removes all of those variables so I can focus on exactly what I want to say and how I want to say it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a dynamic wireframe in real time. I can run this site without worrying about all of the cross-browser testing, design, and technical details I&rsquo;d normally manage. Here I can focus on the flow of the site, the content presented, and the order of information.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve based this site model on <a href="https://buildingastorybrand.com/lay-out-an-effective-home-page/">Donald Miller&rsquo;s Storybrand wireframe tips</a>. I can change the text every day without worrying about having to redesign, or design a new block.</p>

<p>Eventually, if I want, I can code my own site, once it&rsquo;s thoroughly tested with the public.</p>

<p>I will say that I&rsquo;ve already received an email from an eager student. The site&rsquo;s been up for less than 48 hours. That&rsquo;s a sign of success.</p>

<p>I have no training in psychology, but if I had to pick an opposite for Imposter Syndrome, I&rsquo;d choose <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/narcissism">narcissism</a>. You&rsquo;re the best! You&rsquo;re amazing! The world should recognize your brilliance!</p>

<p>In the tech world, Imposter Syndrome seems to infect younger women and older men. Younger women believe they know nothing because they just started their careers. Older men started to realize how little they knew when they just started their careers, and they believe they still know nothing now.</p>

<p>It seems to happen to conference speakers and workshop instructors. Why was I picked to teach this topic? What do I know? If I&rsquo;m not comprehensive in this area, then clearly I know nothing.</p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing to know: <strong>no one has your life experience</strong>. You have a unique perspective on a topic and a unique way of presenting it.</p>

<p>The best way to overcome Imposter Syndrome when teaching is to stop thinking about your 4th grade teacher. (S)he was the teacher, a &ldquo;sage on the stage.&rdquo; You were the student, expected to absorb. Knowledge transfer went one-way only.</p>

<p>Instead, <strong>think of yourself as a coach, leading and guiding the group.</strong> You have some ideas that are important. However, you don&rsquo;t have a lock on the perfect way to teach the topic for everyone. There&rsquo;s value in having other people explain your material to each other. Some of your students have interesting perspective, ideas, and life connections to bring to your material. It&rsquo;s all an important part of an excellent class.</p>

<p>**CONTRAST: **</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Contrasting colors, not a bunch of muddy neutrals</p></li>

<li><p>Contrasting fonts, not Arial and more Arial</p></li>

<li><p>Contrasting size, not sizes 12 and 14</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>REPETITION:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Repeated layouts, not something unique on every page</p></li>

<li><p>Repeated elements, like icons used consistently</p></li>

<li><p>Repeated colors, fonts, sizes</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ALIGNMENT:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Think about straight lines on your web pages, which guide the eye and increase legibility</p></li>

<li><p>On the web, everything looks better LEFT-ALIGNED (see note) and not CENTERED</p></li>

<li><p>CENTERED is for WEDDING INVITATIONS</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(note) in left-to-right languages. If you use a right-to-left language, then use right alignment.</p>

<p><strong>PROXIMITY:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The nearer two elements are on a page, the more likely that they&rsquo;re related.</p></li>

<li><p>You don&rsquo;t have to shove elements into corners because they&rsquo;re empty.</p></li>

<li><p>Separation in space means different ideas. Proximity means related ideas.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The book is full of full-color picture examples illustrating all points.</p>

<p>The tips are simple and easy to follow. It&rsquo;s straightforward to apply them to your own work. Applying them will take your design to the next level.</p>

        <a href="http://learnnocode.dev/2020/12/31/mental-models-are.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-12-31 08:06:12 -0500">Dec 31, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mental-models/">Jakob Nielsen</a> defines mental models from a UX perspective: <strong>&ldquo;A mental model is what the user believes about the system at hand.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://jamesclear.com/feynman-mental-models">James Clear</a>, in a fantastic story about mental models, brings it back to its essence: <strong>&ldquo;If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail&hellip; When a certain worldview dominates your thinking, you’ll try to explain every problem you face through that worldview.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>When we look at web technologies, they are dominated by all kinds of mental models.</p>

<p>The new JavaScript programmers, those who came to the web in the last 5 years or so, believe that the web is JavaScript-first, with HTML and CSS as annoyances that never &ldquo;work&rdquo; correctly. Those who have been in the web field for over 10 years know you start with semantic HTML, layer on the CSS for styling, and use JavaScript sparingly. However, when we&rsquo;ve taught the JavaScript-first model, we wind up with the modern day messes we see dominating the world of custom development.</p>

<p>One of the big advantages I bring to the technology space is a breadth of knowledge in many areas. I started with Dreamweaver and HTML, later bolting on CSS. I moved on to pushing content management systems to their limits. I learned in a time when we didn&rsquo;t have a zillion command-line tools for managing files. I started working with CSS when there were no browser developer tools. All I had was the HTML and CSS from &ldquo;view source.&rdquo; I had to figure out what was broken on my own.</p>

<p>Now as I make the switch from teaching code to teaching no-code, there is so much I bring to this new world.</p>

<ul>
<li>I can ground the problems that no-code tools solve in coding language. Or not.</li>
<li>I can frame the problems no-coders encounter in the words of a model that speaks to them.</li>
<li>Someone needs to teach HTML and CSS to those who will not use it professionally. Our current courses assume you have 27 different command line-based tools and make it look so difficult. But yet, we provide the &ldquo;CSS editing box&rdquo; for those who want to dump in their custom CSS. If you&rsquo;re going to put CSS in that box, you have to know how to write it. And in some ways, this problem is more difficult than what the professionals face. Have you SEEN the crap that passes for HTML these days? Have you tried to override it?</li>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>There are plenty of artists making a living by creating art. Let&rsquo;s define &ldquo;art&rdquo; narrowly here: painting, pottery, handmade jewelry, fiber arts, woodworking, sculpture, etc. The basic stuff you&rsquo;d see at a craft show.</p>

<p>They typically have several outlets for their work, and through the combination, they make their living:</p>

<ul>
<li>personal studio space where they create work, which may also have a show space (or a separate show space)</li>
<li>craft shows, previously all in-person, now some virtual</li>
<li>Etsy store</li>
<li>Galleries</li>
</ul>

<p>Fundamentally, artists love making art. The business side is what they do to support their work.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve realized I&rsquo;m an artist too. I create courses. I create lots and lots of courses. I put them out in the world in many ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>higher education via Harvard Extension</li>
<li>commercial video courses at LinkedIn Learning, Frontend Masters</li>
<li>conference talks and workshops</li>
</ul>

<p>But although I have a &ldquo;home studio&rdquo; where I create content, I don&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;show space&rdquo; of any kind. For artists, that&rsquo;s usually where they start.</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s time to fix that.</p>

         	<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s best to simply move forward with something and reset the goal as you move forward.</p>

<p>Rather than initially setting the goal as &ldquo;I&rsquo;m reworking my entire life and this is my future full-time job,&rdquo; start with &ldquo;this seems like a super fun thing to do, so I&rsquo;m going to do it and see what happens.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dinaaamin.com/">dina Amin</a> was an inspiration for pursuing fun. I saw her speak at the October 2019 Smashing Conference. She told a story of how she enjoyed taking things apart. Then she got a camera and figured out stop-motion photography. She made adorable little videos from the things she took apart. People love her work, and it eventually started to pay the bills through conference talks, commissions, workshops, commercial work, and so forth. This is the model of an artist.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also hard to think about a problem when you&rsquo;re personally invested in it. When I think about new businesses, I think about all of the things that could go wrong, what happens if no one likes it or wants it, what happens if it doesn&rsquo;t make enough money (or any money), and so forth. These doubts are powerful.</p>

<p>But what if it goes right? Sometimes that&rsquo;s even more scary.</p>

			<h1><a href="http://learnnocode.dev/2020/12/28/foundations-of-a.html">Foundations of a good conference talk</a></h1>
		

        <a href="http://learnnocode.dev/2020/12/28/foundations-of-a.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-12-28 09:14:45 -0500">Dec 28, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In non-pandemic times, I speak at a lot of conferences. While there, I attend talks.</p>

<p>There are two ways to look at every talk at a conference.</p>

<p><strong>a. It is adding on to a topic or area that you already know well.</strong> As a CSS expert, any CSS talks usually fall in this category for me.</p>

<p><strong>b. You know nothing about the topic, but you&rsquo;ve heard about it peripherally and have some curiosity in this area.</strong> I&rsquo;m not a JavaScript expert. However, I&rsquo;m curious about what problems the latest JavaScript framework addresses. What are the advantages of React over Vue? Vue over React? Why do we need all of these frameworks anyway?</p>

<p>In the first 3-5 minutes of your talk, you can satisfy both of these audiences quickly and easily by grounding the audience in the technology you&rsquo;re presenting.</p>

<p>Amazing! How do you do it?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&ldquo;The technology I&rsquo;m talking about today is Y. Y is {type of technology} that addresses ABC problems. It&rsquo;s put out by JKL Corporation/open source project/whatever, under a DEF license. It requires GHI technologies to configure and run.&rdquo; (describe dependencies, technology stack, or server configurations here)</p></li>

<li><p>&ldquo;Y solves the following types of problems&hellip;&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>&ldquo;You may wonder why we need Y, when we already have X, which addresses the same problems.  X and Y are indeed similar, so let&rsquo;s compare their strengths and weaknesses.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s get into the meat of Y.&rdquo; (Time to go geeky wild!!!)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This formula conveys all kinds of background information about your technology very quickly. In 5 minutes, as a geeky person fluent in web technologies, I&rsquo;ve got all of the high-level details I need to decide if Y is any interest to me at all. That is an excellent talk already. Five stars!</p>

<p>What if you already know X? Well, in 5 minutes, you may still pick up a nugget you didn&rsquo;t know before, or make a connection you hadn&rsquo;t previously made. For example, when you look at strengths and weaknesses of various technologies, you may not have been able to articulate why you&rsquo;re so excited about Y to your boss. Now you have the argument to do it.</p>

<p>By the way, the <strong>true experts</strong> in technology never mind these high level discussions or think less of you for giving them. Everyone must learn sometime. If you can explain a technology in 5 minutes, that&rsquo;s mastery in action.</p>

<p>The next time you give a talk, internally at your company or externally at a conference, keep these points in mind.</p>

<p><strong>You don&rsquo;t have to be comprehensive in your presentation. You need to be memorable.</strong></p>

<p>And being comprehensive means you&rsquo;re not memorable.</p>

<p>Present so the audience learns and remembers, not like a specification. We can always look up the specification later.</p>

<p>When I started in this industry, the gatekeepers were understanding files and folders, FTP, and syntax errors.</p>

<p>Those gatekeepers are still around, but there&rsquo;s much more now: command lines; configuring the computer with more complicated technology to get around files, folders, and FTP; new kinds of syntax errors. Tech bros. Smugness. Dismissiveness of anyone not white, male, and no more than 33 years old. A belief that technology must be complicated and hurt to work.</p>

<p>Also: &ldquo;Really? You&rsquo;ve never heard of XYZ technology?&rdquo; Deliver this line with a slight air of smugness and superiority. Follow that with, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be happy to sit down with you and walk you through it,&rdquo; again delivered in a very slightly condescending way, implying that you cannot figure out this information on your own and thank goodness there&rsquo;s someone to help you.</p>

<p>The motivation for teaching is often to get attention or get famous, show off their personal skills, gain fortune, or to try to be an early dominator in some obscure technology or another.</p>

<p>Notice how not one of those reasons is <strong>to help other people.</strong></p>

<p>In other words, these prospective teachers want to be the <strong>hero</strong>, not a <strong>guide</strong>.</p>

<p>A hero is Batman. A guide is Alfred.</p>

<p>Super proud of how my studio is coming along.</p>

<p>I never thought I&rsquo;d have a home recording studio. Then there was a pandemic.</p>

<p>Where I&rsquo;d been traveling to California to record LinkedIn Learning courses 3-4 times per year, recording 2-3 courses per trip, I was suddenly reduced to no travel.</p>

<p>I started recording at home, screencast recordings only, without me on camera. That&rsquo;s when we thought maybe we&rsquo;d be able to resume in-person recording in the fall.</p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;re experimenting with on-camera recording. I know nothing about cameras, video, sound, lighting, or anything else in that realm. But now I have free consulting from some very talented LinkedIn Learning staff, who are able to recommend equipment, walk me through setting it up, and helping me look and sound the best I can.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine that we&rsquo;ll be back to 100% on-site recording at LinkedIn when the pandemic is over. A home studio becomes an asset that I can use in many other ways going forward.

<h2 id="sidebar-preamble">Sidebar Preamble</h2>

<p>My <a href="https://www.jenkramer.org">current website</a> is a total embarrassment.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve needed to change it for years. In fact, it&rsquo;s been on my whiteboard &ldquo;things to do&rdquo; for <strong>five years.</strong></p>

<p>As I move into the world of no-code, I&rsquo;m redesigning my site with many different no-code platforms. I&rsquo;ll be trying out different platforms and putting together some kind of website over the next several weeks.</p>

<p><a href="https://learnnocode.dev/2020/12/23/redesigning-jenkramerorg-an.html">Read more about the project</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="today-s-lovely-contestants">Today&rsquo;s Lovely Contestants</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started with <a href="https://www.softr.io">Softr.io</a>  and <a href="https://www.airtable.com/">Airtable</a> because I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of buzz about Softr lately. As for Airtable, I already had a base available that I need to integrate into my site better.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="airtable-base">Airtable base</h3>

<p>Earlier this year, I created a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/no-code-solutions-for-websites-and-apps/organize-data-with-airtable">single video on Airtable for LinkedIn Learning</a>. It&rsquo;s a base of currently active video courses I&rsquo;ve created for different publishers.</p>

<p><em>Base: Airtable&rsquo;s word for &ldquo;database.&rdquo; I guess database is too scary.</em></p>

<p>The base, as it currently exists, is <a href="https://airtable.com/shrE6tr0nt0tPVhLi">public and available for viewing</a>.</p>

<p>I have this integrated on my current website via iframe. Again, easy, low maintenance, but there&rsquo;s more that can be done with Airtable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="softr">Softr</h3>

<p>Feels very much like Squarespace, but with fewer design features, less heavy lifting, and more integration with other tools.</p>

<p>There are a few templates to choose from, but these are just assemblages of blocks with a certain theme. These templates seem to drive content in the no-code space. Probably another topic for another rant sometime&hellip; this is not exclusively a Softr thing.</p>

<p>Choose from a series of &ldquo;blocks&rdquo; with fixed layouts to assemble the page. Populate with data. Limited ability for changes to colors, fonts, layouts.</p>

<p>The state of jenkramer.org is pretty horrible.</p>

<p>I redesigned this site in 2014 using Bootstrap 3, LESS for styling, and PHP includes.</p>

<p>You might be wondering why I chose those technologies, of all of the technologies that were out there.</p>

<p>a. Keep in mind that while 2014 was only 7 years minus one week ago, <strong>the web has changed radically since then.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The initial React release was in mid-2013. Angular was in 2016. We were in a period of "framework flavor of the month" at this point. Every conference seemed to have people desperate to dominate the next big thing in JavaScript. There were a lot of things coming out then.</li>

<li><strong>jQuery was still very much a thing in 2014.</strong> jQuery Mobile was starting to decline with the availability (and superior responsive design) of Bootstrap. jQuery UI wasn't responsive and was declining as well, plus Bootstrap had its own UI components.</li>

<li><strong>Bootstrap was a massive game-changer on the front-end.</strong> In 2014, people were only starting to transition to Flexbox for layouts from floats. People don't understand floats for layout. And people definitely don't understand CSS. Responsive design was still a mystery to many people, particularly how to code it by hand. And Bootstrap was HUGE in the bootcamps, which were thriving by this point. Indeed, that's often how CSS was taught: Here's Bootstrap. Use it.</li>

<li>Grunt might have been a thing, with Gulp gaining traction. Webpack didn't exist. Node was out there, but only just getting started. </li>

  <li>This sounds like my web stories from 20 years ago. <strong>Keep in mind it's only been SEVEN YEARS. </strong></li>
  </ul>

<p>b. <strong>Bootstrap only integrated with LESS at this point.</strong> Sass integration was coming, but not for a while.</p>

<p>c. OK, PHP includes were old, even then. But they are super easy to configure, and they gave me some simple moving parts for repeated content on the site to make maintenance easier. <strong>Technology doesn&rsquo;t have to hurt to work, people.</strong></p>

<p>d. It&rsquo;s only a 10 page website. I wasn&rsquo;t blogging. I wasn&rsquo;t trying to sell anything. No one was maintaining the site but me. I could have installed WordPress, but then I&rsquo;d have to maintain it. <strong>There wasn&rsquo;t any real reason to build anything but a static site.</strong></p>

<h2 id="redesign-time">Redesign time</h2>

<p>So why does one need to redesign?
<ul>
<li><strong>The technology driving the site is old and dated. It&rsquo;s too hard to maintain, or it&rsquo;s a security threat. </strong><br>
Well&hellip; yeah, OK, Bootstrap 3 is old, and so are PHP includes. But nothing is a security threat here, and I don&rsquo;t mind writing HTML to update content. Basically, I&rsquo;m &ldquo;meh&rdquo; on my tech stack, as long as the site is telling a good story. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t need to take hours to set up a development environment, or installing things, or figuring out why X in the stack isn&rsquo;t working. I don&rsquo;t have time for that. It&rsquo;s a simple website.</li></p>

<p><li><strong>The content is dated and needs revising.</strong><br>
THIS is the reason the site needs a redesign. There&rsquo;s waaaaay too much blah blah on the site. Nothing is focused. It&rsquo;s all over the place, trying to be comprehensive. So time to focus the story.</li></p>

<h2 id="focusing-the-story">Focusing the story</h2>

<p>I have a lot of writing to do before I&rsquo;m ready to redesign completely. Honestly, this is a separate post to explain what I&rsquo;m doing and why.</p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s just say it&rsquo;s this, in a nutshell:</p>

<p><ul>
    <li>Cut the blah blah in half, or three-quarters.</li></p>

<p><li>More showing, less telling.</li></p>

<p><li>Use Donald Miller&rsquo;s Storybrand principles to drive layout.</li></p>

<p><li>Reframe the site to the customer as hero, rather than I&rsquo;m the hero. (Also Donald Miller.)</li>
  </ul></p>

<h2 id="the-plan">The Plan</h2>

<p>Since I&rsquo;m pivoting to the no-code world (probably another story elsewhere), I&rsquo;m going to try out a bunch of no-code tools to see what I can learn and create in those environments.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll try creating something once a week as possible.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll post the results here, along with a review.</p>

<p>These might not be the final versions of my site. Indeed, they&rsquo;re probably not. But they&rsquo;re a great way to try out the products, identify positives and negatives of each, and decide what I want to do going forward.</p>

<p><li>Padding -&gt; spacing inside</li></p>

<p><li>Typography -&gt; Fonts (use Word terminology)</li>
  </ul></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s more than database -&gt; collection/base/etc.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a pile of 20-somethings building no-code tools without realizing that many of these problems have been solved before. We&rsquo;ve all seen the movie already.</p>

<p>In 2005, we had a battle between WordPress and Joomla. WordPress won. They had a great user interface. They tested it carefully and made sure it was &ldquo;intuitive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today, no-code tools are &ldquo;intuitive and easy to use&rdquo; for the people who build them, or the people who are invested in learning them. They are not easy to pick up. User testing would show that these tools are still pretty uniformly horrible.</p>

<p>No-code isn&rsquo;t getting rid of coding syntax, but keeping all of the names, labels, and requirements of coding.</p>

<p>You have to take it a step further. If I still have to know how to think about an application, how to build it, where the data is going, which box is the right one to apply the class, then you haven&rsquo;t really solved my no-code problems.</p>

<p>Start with terminology. Stop thinking like a coder.</p>

<p>One of the things that bothers me about no-code approaches is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debt</a>.</p>

<p><strong>It&rsquo;s 1996 in the No-Code Universe.</strong> As the web was in 1996, the No-Code Universe is at the phase where the tools are exploding, the money flows like kegs of beer at a frat party, and new companies are created, get bought, and go under every day.</p>

<p>We will come out with some winners, but as we should have learned from the web, there will be far more losers than winners. The consolidation will be significant. Your data will slosh around all over Silicon Valley, and you may not even realize it&rsquo;s happening.</p>

<p>Be sure you know how to get your data out of a system before you commit your business to running on it as a platform.</p>

<p>When I started working as web professional in 2000, there were no &ldquo;tools.&rdquo; You used a text editor or you used Macromedia Dreamweaver (current version: 3).</p>

<p>The #1 client request was to be able to edit their own website without having to go through their web designer. That&rsquo;s because most web designers SUCKED. They were utterly incapable of answering or returning phone calls or emails. The common story was the designer sitting on the client request for weeks at a time.</p>

<p>Then in 2002, along came Macromedia Contribute. Designed to integrate with Dreamweaver templates, this simple&reg; software let clients make their own updates to their websites.</p>

<p>Much handwringing ensued. OMG, there would soon be NO WORK for web designers!</p>

<p>Of course, nothing could have been further from the truth. There was plenty of work for web designers. However, if &ldquo;work&rdquo; meant fixing typos or updating copy, yeah, you did lose out on some of that. But there was still a ridiculous amount of work for those wanting to build new websites.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2020. The latest round of no-code tools are allowing people to automate tasks, build forms, create their own simple websites, and integrate technologies without developers.</p>

<p>Much handwringing ensued. OMG, there would soon be NO WORK for programmers!</p>

<p>And just like before, nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

<p>a. Who codes the no-code tools?&hellip;</p>

<p>b. Who does one call when one pushes no-code to the limit, or wants that one feature that seems to be nowhere in the no-code space?</p>

<p>c. The power of creation from nothing will still lie with programmers. But the junk work of building yet another form that emails the contents to the owner, or writes it to some spreadsheet? That stuff is going to go away.</p>

<p>Trust me, you won&rsquo;t miss it.</p>
