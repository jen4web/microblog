				"content_html": "<p>Interactions on discussion boards hundreds of times a day&hellip;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flexbox Froggy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is not a good way to learn Flexbox.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Yes, it asks students to recall values for properties associated with Flexbox. Yes, it gives you an adorable visual for how those properties and values impact the layout of frogs on lily pads.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Level 8, shown above, involves the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->flex-direction<!-- raw HTML omitted --> CSS property, which has a series of possible values. All of this is explained above the window for typing in the appropriate code to align the frogs to the lilypads.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Is the game fun? Absolutely! Students engage with the game quickly and easily. (Yes, also Flexbox Zombies and Flexbox Defender, which are similar games to teach Flexbox properties, with similar flaws to Flexbox Froggy.)</p>\n<p>Do students know Flexbox once they reach level 24, the last possible level? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Teaches<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a strong word.</p>\n<p>Flexbox Froggy asks students to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->remember<!-- raw HTML omitted --> specific CSS properties and the appropriate value to solve layout problems.</p>\n<p>Students may <!-- raw HTML omitted -->understand<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or recognize where to place these properties to achieve prescribed layouts. Levels 1-23 all tell the students which properties will solve the presented layout problem. It does not always present the possible properties, asking students to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->remember<!-- raw HTML omitted --> those properties.</p>\n<p>Level 24, the last level of the game, is unique in that it asks students to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->apply<!-- raw HTML omitted --> any of the properties to solve the final layout problem. This is the only level where there are possible incorrect properties provided.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Because these words are the basis of Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy, a way of describing levels of learning and their depth.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Applied to the coding world, these first three levels of Bloom&rsquo;s refer to concepts like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>recalling syntax</li>\n<li>remembering HTML elements and attributes, CSS properties and values</li>\n<li>understanding what those elements, attributes, properties, and values mean, and describing their impact on some code</li>\n<li>filling in partially solved coding problems with appropriate lines of code to make it &ldquo;work&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sounds basic, no? That&rsquo;s because it is. What if we had some other formats to truly bring learning to the students once they were introduced to the Flexbox properties and values?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What if we asked students to solve problems without giving them the appropriate properties to use?</li>\n<li>What if we didn&rsquo;t provide a list of values?</li>\n<li>What if we didn&rsquo;t imply how many lines of CSS it would take to solve the problem?</li>\n<li>What if we gave students the wrong code and asked them to fix it to achieve the layout?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, consider Flexbox&rsquo;s critical parent/child (or flex-container/flex-item) relationship in HTML elements. Depending on where <!-- raw HTML omitted -->display: flex;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is declared, that HTML element becomes the flex container. Its immediate descendents are flex items. Grandchildren and deeper descendents are unaffected. This directly impacts the styling of the page and is one of the biggest overlooked and misunderstood concepts when learning Flexbox. However, Flexbox Froggy never touches this discussion, focusing mostly on flex container properties. (Indeed, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->order<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a property that specifically applies to children, is mixed with the parent properties. This amplifies learner confusion as this property &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t work&rdquo; when applied to the parent.)</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Try my CodePen<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which emulates Level 24 in Flexbox Froggy. Match up the colors in the appropriate layout where the comment indicates. Can you do it? If not, why?</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Uh, I&rsquo;m not a CSS expert.&rdquo; Mmm hmm.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>If we look at almost any &ldquo;teaching resource&rdquo; for learning code, you will find similar problems. Coding instructors are all over the <strong>remember</strong>, <strong>understand</strong>, and <strong>apply</strong> levels of Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy.</p>\n<p>Then the instructors immediately jump you to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->create<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. &ldquo;Now that you know everything about Flexbox, go lay out a web page. Have fun!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What happened to <strong>analyze</strong> and <strong>evaluate</strong>?</p>\n<p>These are the levels where deep thinking happens. Now that you have a general idea of how a concept works, it&rsquo;s time to dig in further. Do you really understand what was taught to you? Can you predict what happens if certain properties or values are applied to a layout? Can you debug incorrect code? Can you provide an explanation about why this code works &ndash; or why that code doesn&rsquo;t?</p>\n<p><strong>This is what&rsquo;s missing in today&rsquo;s coding education.</strong> It is assumed students are equipped to do this work on their own.

				"content_text": "Interactions on discussion boards hundreds of times a day...\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/4127c4089a.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"437\" alt=\"Person 1: OMG Flexbox is so hard, I can't understand, can anyone help me. Person 2: Have u played the flex frog game... simple but helped me get some basics. flexboxfroggy.com\">\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.flexboxfroggy.com\" target=\"_blank\">Flexbox Froggy</a> is not a good way to learn Flexbox.</strong> Yes, it asks students to recall values for properties associated with Flexbox. Yes, it gives you an adorable visual for how those properties and values impact the layout of frogs on lily pads.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/703a666670.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"138\" alt=\"Screenshot showing frogs not quite aligned with their lilypads.\" />\n<em>Level 8: Frogs are not quite aligned with their lilypads to start.</em>\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/e158400745.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"159\" alt=\"After typing in the appropriate Flexbox code in question, the frogs align with their lilypads.\" />\n<em>After typing in the appropriate Flexbox CSS properties and values, the frogs align to their lilypads. Adorable.</em>\n\nLevel 8, shown above, involves the <code>flex-direction</code> CSS property, which has a series of possible values. All of this is explained above the window for typing in the appropriate code to align the frogs to the lilypads.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/c34e170390.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"415\" alt=\"Flexbox Froggy level 8, explaining the flex-direction property, its possible values of row, row-reverse, column, or column-reverse, and a blank to type in the correct property-value pair.\" />\n\nIs the game fun? Absolutely! Students engage with the game quickly and easily. (Yes, also Flexbox Zombies and Flexbox Defender, which are similar games to teach Flexbox properties, with similar flaws to Flexbox Froggy.)\n\nDo students know Flexbox once they reach level 24, the last possible level? <strong>No.</strong>\n\n<h3>But it teaches CSS properties! That's awesome!</h3>\n\n<strong>Teaches</strong> is a strong word. \n\nFlexbox Froggy asks students to <strong>remember</strong> specific CSS properties and the appropriate value to solve layout problems. \n\nStudents may <strong>understand</strong> or recognize where to place these properties to achieve prescribed layouts. Levels 1-23 all tell the students which properties will solve the presented layout problem. It does not always present the possible properties, asking students to <strong>remember</strong> those properties.\n\nLevel 24, the last level of the game, is unique in that it asks students to <strong>apply</strong> any of the properties to solve the final layout problem. This is the only level where there are possible incorrect properties provided.\n\n<h3>Why did you emphasize remember, understand, and apply?</h3>\n\nBecause these words are the basis of Bloom's Taxonomy, a way of describing levels of learning and their depth. \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/8b37229b16.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"Bloom's Taxonomy pyramid, showing the levels of remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and create.\" />\n<em>Armstrong, P. (2010). Bloom’s Taxonomy. Vanderbilt University Center for Teaching. Retrieved October 28, 2022, from https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/.</em>\n \nApplied to the coding world, these first three levels of Bloom's refer to concepts like:\n\n* recalling syntax \n* remembering HTML elements and attributes, CSS properties and values\n* understanding what those elements, attributes, properties, and values mean, and describing their impact on some code\n* filling in partially solved coding problems with appropriate lines of code to make it \"work\"\n\nSounds basic, no? That's because it is. What if we had some other formats to truly bring learning to the students once they were introduced to the Flexbox properties and values?\n\n* What if we asked students to solve problems without giving them the appropriate properties to use?\n* What if we didn't provide a list of values?\n* What if we didn't imply how many lines of CSS it would take to solve the problem?\n* What if we gave students the wrong code and asked them to fix it to achieve the layout?\n\nFinally, consider Flexbox's critical parent/child (or flex-container/flex-item) relationship in HTML elements. Depending on where <code>display: flex;</code> is declared, that HTML element becomes the flex container. Its immediate descendents are flex items. Grandchildren and deeper descendents are unaffected. This directly impacts the styling of the page and is one of the biggest overlooked and misunderstood concepts when learning Flexbox. However, Flexbox Froggy never touches this discussion, focusing mostly on flex container properties. (Indeed, <code>order</code>, a property that specifically applies to children, is mixed with the parent properties. This amplifies learner confusion as this property \"doesn't work\" when applied to the parent.)\n\n<h3>Well, ok, but I totally learned Flexbox with these games</h3>\n\n<a href=\"https://codepen.io/jen4web/pen/OJEVyzr\" target=\"blank\">Try my CodePen</a> which emulates Level 24 in Flexbox Froggy. Match up the colors in the appropriate layout where the comment indicates. Can you do it? If not, why?\n\n\"Uh, I'm not a CSS expert.\" Mmm hmm.\n\n<h3>What are you leading up to, Jen?</h3>\n\nIf we look at almost any \"teaching resource\" for learning code, you will find similar problems. Coding instructors are all over the **remember**, **understand**, and **apply** levels of Bloom's Taxonomy.\n\nThen the instructors immediately jump you to <strong>create</strong>. \"Now that you know everything about Flexbox, go lay out a web page. Have fun!\"\n\nWhat happened to **analyze** and **evaluate**?\n\nThese are the levels where deep thinking happens. Now that you have a general idea of how a concept works, it's time to dig in further. Do you really understand what was taught to you? Can you predict what happens if certain properties or values are applied to a layout? Can you debug incorrect code? Can you provide an explanation about why this code works -- or why that code doesn't?\n\n**This is what's missing in today's coding education.** It is assumed students are equipped to do this work on their own. It's assumed they know this is what comes next, and it's assumed that they will do it. \n\nUnfortunately, students **do not** know that this is what they should do next, and they don't know how to ask these questions. The instructor must lead through these levels, increasing student independence, before turning students loose on their own creative projects.\n\nExpect to hear more from me about this over the coming months. \n\nIf you want to hear more about how to teach well online, be sure to subscribe to my Substack newsletter that covers these topics.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://jen4web.substack.com/embed\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" style=\"border:1px solid #EEE; background:white;\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n",

				"content_text": "<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://learntoteach.tech/uploads/2021/ce5d048daf.jpg\"/>\nTime for the 2021 retrospective on what was accomplished this year. To what may we point as evidence of work completed?\n\n<h2>Harvard Extension School</h2>\nMy time ended at Harvard on June 30. During the spring term, I taught my final courses, including:\n\n- <strong>Modern & Mobile Web Design 2</strong>: Sass, CSS variables and calc, print stylesheets, advanced media queries, meaty final project (students built their own responsive design framework)\n\n- <strong>Intro to CMS</strong>: This popular WordPress project course had students building 6 sites during the term and planning 1 site, including e-commerce, custom fields, custom theming, and a final project site.\n\n- <strong>Designing Stories for the Web</strong>: Taught with Martha Nichols, a journalist, this course was about learning to write well for the web and getting your stories posted online in WordPress. So far as I'm aware, no one else is teaching a course like this one.\n\n In addition to the teaching work, I took the educational video course (which was excellent) and finished my certificate in Learning Design and Technology. This was a series of 4 courses, including an intro to instructional design, adult learning theory, video editing, and a course in online course design.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/a66638b96f.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"459\" alt=\"Certificate in Learning Design and Technology.\" />\n\n\n <h2>LinkedIn Learning</h2>\nI've worked with LinkedIn Learning since 2008, when they were Lynda.com. Historically, I'd prep 2-3 courses over a period of 4-6 months, then travel to California to record them over a week or so. However, the pandemic changed everything. These days, I prep and record about one course per month, starting about the middle of 2020. Here's a list of all of the courses that were released in 2021:\n\n- [CSS: Display](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/css-display), a short course devoted to a single CSS property.\n- [HTML & CSS: Linking](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/html-and-css-linking). How much is there to say about links? A ton, actually -- navbars, links, buttons, and all of the associated styling.\n- [Learning Editor X](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-editor-x). Editor X is a web design tool from Wix, targeted at graphic designers who want to make sites without code. It fills a gap that Dreamweaver used to fill. Webflow is a direct competitor.\n- [Semantic HTML and CSS Code Challenges](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/semantic-html-and-css-code-challenges). A series of 12 challenges to practice semantic HTML and CSS coding, including Flexbox, Grid, and navbars.\n- [Joomla! 4 First Look](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/joomla-4-first-look). My first Joomla course in 5 years looks at the most recent Joomla 4 release, highlighting the latest features. \n- [Learning Wix](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-wix-14169995). I first recorded this course in 2019. This is an update.\n- [HTML and CSS: Creating Navigation Bars](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/html-and-css-creating-navigation-bars).

Formerly \"Accidental Web Designer,\" this course releases a short weekly video about what's happening around the no-code space. It provides tips for content, marketing, and technology.\n\n I've already recorded two courses for release next year, including a more in-depth Joomla 4 course, and an introduction to web design and development. \n\nHere's a still shot of the temporary dining room recording space I set up for the web design course.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/ce5d048daf.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"326\" alt=\"Jen in her temporary dining room studio, recording for LinkedIn Learning.\" />\n\n<h2>Frontend Masters</h2>\nFrontend Masters is much more about hard-core programming than it is about no-code or UX. I recorded two courses with them this year, with a third to record in March next year.\n\n- [CSS Grid & Flexbox for Responsive Layouts, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-grid-flexbox-v2/). I recorded this course originally in 2017. Finally this year, I updated this with the latest Flexbox and Grid technologies. \n- [Getting Started with CSS](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/getting-started-css/). This is a project course, building a portfolio using basic HTML and CSS. We use responsive design, CSS grid, Flexbox, and CSS variables to put the site together.

At the same time, I coordinated with LinkedIn regarding appropriate equipment for configuring my studio space. I now have a dedicated room in my home for making video, including a teleprompter, DSLR camera, Yeti X mic, and a nice background for recording.\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/31801a32f2.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"Jen's video studio has a teleprompter, camera, and nice backdrop.\" />\n\nAs a result, I started to dabble in making more YouTube videos and doing some live streaming sessions. They were all really fantastic to do. I'd like to do more, but as you can see above, I've been too busy doing other things to spend much time here... so far.\n\nOther various \"other\" highlights: \n\n- I'm serving as an advisor to 2U's UX/UI Bootcamp program, talking with them about curriculum periodically.\n- Erika Lee and I wrote [#30DaysOfHTML](https://learnwithjen.com/l/30daysofhtmlebook) and [#15DaysOfCSS](https://learnwithjen.com/l/15DaysOfCSS). These were free email series that were turned into ebooks. They were a ton of work but helped us build a substantial mailing list.\n- Erika and I turned our reflection on #30DaysOfHTML into conference talks, speaking at both [PSEWeb](https://pseweb.ca/) and at [HighEdWeb](https://events.highedweb.org/heweb21/session/559123/30-days-of-html-lessons-learned-presenting-training-by-email) with our talk \"30 Days of HTML: Lessons Learned Presenting Training by Email.\"\n- Spoke at [No Code Conf 2021](https://webflow.com/nocodeconf/session/5-steps-to-effective-planning-for-your-no-code-website-or-app), talking about planning no-code websites and apps. I gave away some [awesome worksheets](https://bit.ly/nocodeconf2021) to walk you through the process.\n\n<h2>Next year</h2>\nDoes the craziness end? Nope. \n\n- LinkedIn and I have outlined 8 courses for 2022, but that only takes us through August. 😉\n- Frontend Masters and I have scheduled \"[HTML Semantics & CSS Selectors\n](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/semantics-selectors/)\"  to record on March 15. \n- I'm starting to work more with other software companies to create training specifically for them. \n- I've also got my own training platform ready to build, with the first course likely to release early next year.\n\nKeep watching! There will be much more teaching from me coming in 2022 in the realm of HTML, CSS, UX, and no-code technologies.\n\n",

				"title": "How to make HTML exciting again",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Today I received the best compliment on my #30DaysofHTML course, even before it launches.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>This gets to the heart of why I started this challenge and my thinking behind it.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>HTML is the scaffolding behind a web page. It&rsquo;s as exciting as framing a house, or [playing bass or drums in a rock band] (<a href=\"https://jen4web.substack.com/p/use-the-full-frontend-or-create-junk)\">https://jen4web.substack.com/p/use-the-full-frontend-or-create-junk)</a>. In other words, there&rsquo;s some artistry, but it&rsquo;s underappreciated by most. Done right, it&rsquo;s in the shadow of way more exciting and interesting elements of the project. However, without it, nothing else matters &ndash; HTML is foundational to a website.</p>\n<p>When developers teach new developers HTML, it&rsquo;s presented as a necessary evil. As little time as possible is spent on it, because everyone wants to get on to making things pretty and interactive &ndash; neither of which is a thing with HTML. Quick quick, here&rsquo;s a tag, here&rsquo;s an attribute, open/close things &ndash; whew, let&rsquo;s move on.</p>\n<p><strong>As a result, HTML is the mushroom of the web world. It&rsquo;s kept in the dark, and it eats a lot of crap by people who see nothing to love.</strong></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><em>The purpose of the Hypertext Markup Language is to identify the parts of the web page: paragraphs, lists, headings, links, addresses, quotations, and so much more.</em> How many times have I said this sentence in 20 years of teaching?</p>\n<p>But finally, I made a connection: <strong>HTML is intimately tied to the story of the website.</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone wants to be heard and understood. Everyone wants their story heard. <strong>Great HTML is the way to communicate your story to the world.</strong></p>\n<p>When I was 14 months old and hungry, I would pull on my mother&rsquo;s pant leg, point to the counter looming over my head, and grunt, &ldquo;Cookie.&rdquo; (Or so my mother says. I do not remember.) She would respond by giving me fruit, crackers, a bowl of dry Cheerios, or whatever else a 14 month old eats. Not a cookie, no matter hard I tried. Or she&rsquo;d tell me it was almost dinner time and go away and leave her to finish it.</p>\n<p>Consider that your crappy HTML is telling this same story. If your website is nothing but one &lt; div &gt; after another, you&rsquo;re just saying COOKIE COOKIE COOKIE. You&rsquo;re 14 months old, with a limited grasp of vocabulary.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>So. How do you convince developers, who just love everything pretty and interactive, that their framing sucks and doesn&rsquo;t work? Their code that sits on top of it works just fine. Framing is SO BORING.</p>\n<p>Well, accessibility, of course! It&rsquo;s absolutely critical. Accessibility should start at the beginning. It should always be incorporated in the site. Good accessibility starts with meaningful HTML.</p>\n<p>But &ndash; what the accessibility advocates are doing is not effective to get developer attention. They are, unfortunately, ignored for the most part.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve (maybe) gotten (some) busy developers to feel guilty about their bad HTML. But changing it takes effort. Learning what HTML elements are available takes time and research. Time that could be spent learning the latest JavaScript framework.</p>\n<p>Time for a new story with new framing.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>If we focus on HTML&rsquo;s syntax, that&rsquo;s not interesting. What&rsquo;s interesting is the meaning conveyed behind the elements. Why choose one element over another? How does that element contribute to the website&rsquo;s story?</p>\n<p>30DaysofHTML incorporates the following concepts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Focus on the meaning behind the elements. When should something be used or not used?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t overwhelm with all of the edge cases and complexity. Provide just enough information to feel like you know a little bit, and provide links to everything else.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Identify any misconceptions about the element. HTML looks like English. The &lt; address &gt; element, for example, looks like it&rsquo;s for a postal address. However, it can be used for any contact information associated with an article or website author, including phone numbers, email address, social media links, or even geographic coordinates. Who knew that? That&rsquo;s interesting and fun and different.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remove the pretty and interactive, so learners are forced to focus on the scaffolding. We aren&rsquo;t concerned with cross-device presentation or UX or anything else. It&rsquo;s black text on a white page. There&rsquo;s nothing else to do here&hellip; by design.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encourage application, reflection, and discussion. Not only should there be a little reading, but there should be some examples and problems to try too. Maybe the occasional quiz. Encourage readers to share their work and comment on each other&rsquo;s markup and approaches. Put the discussion on the meaning we&rsquo;re trying to convey.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And finally, make it fun. Make some fun graphics, throw in a few emojis, use all of the web writing techniques to break up content with headings and lists. Write in a fun and informal style.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>[&quot;&lt; address &gt; should be used for addresses. You guessed that already. But what kind of addresses, and in what context?&quot;] (<a href=\"https://jen4web.substack.com/p/address\">https://jen4web.substack.com/p/address</a>)</p>\n<p>Draw the reader in. Make them curious. Conflict is interesting. The lure of something that perhaps you don&rsquo;t know is intriguing.</p>\n<p>I also sent out a [&ldquo;Night Before&rdquo;] (<a href=\"https://jen4web.substack.com/p/twas-the-night-before-30daysofhtml\">https://jen4web.substack.com/p/twas-the-night-before-30daysofhtml</a>) email, explaining what to expect and how it will all work. This sets anxious learners at ease, and it sets expectations and generates interest. It also sets metrics for what success looks like.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The &ldquo;X Days&rdquo; format is popular at this moment. People talk about #100DaysofCode and #100DaysofNoCode and such. Why not #30DaysofHTML? Fortunately, it explains everything you need to know in the hashtag. 30 days, talking about HTML.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Email is the format for delivery. It&rsquo;s simple, easy, and everyone has it.

				"content_text": "<img src=\"uploads/2021/480d999f5d.png\" width=\"853\" height=\"141\" alt=\"#30DaysofHTML banner graphic.\" />\n\nToday I received the best compliment on my #30DaysofHTML course, even before it launches.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I don't know how you've managed it, but you've gotten me all excited about HTML.</p>— ოarῐa ᥨaῃ𝙜әr 🚁😷💉🇺🇸 (@mlanger) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mlanger/status/1377610956323229700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 1, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nThis gets to the heart of why I started this challenge and my thinking behind it.\n\n<h3>How HTML is normally taught</h3>\n\nHTML is the scaffolding behind a web page. It's as exciting as framing a house, or [playing bass or drums in a rock band] (https://jen4web.substack.com/p/use-the-full-frontend-or-create-junk). In other words, there's some artistry, but it's underappreciated by most. Done right, it's in the shadow of way more exciting and interesting elements of the project. However, without it, nothing else matters -- HTML is foundational to a website.\n\nWhen developers teach new developers HTML, it's presented as a necessary evil. As little time as possible is spent on it, because everyone wants to get on to making things pretty and interactive -- neither of which is a thing with HTML. Quick quick, here's a tag, here's an attribute, open/close things -- whew, let's move on.\n\n**As a result, HTML is the mushroom of the web world. It's kept in the dark, and it eats a lot of crap by people who see nothing to love.**\n\n<h3>I love mushrooms</h3>\n\n*The purpose of the Hypertext Markup Language is to identify the parts of the web page: paragraphs, lists, headings, links, addresses, quotations, and so much more.* How many times have I said this sentence in 20 years of teaching?\n\nBut finally, I made a connection: **HTML is intimately tied to the story of the website.**\n\nEveryone wants to be heard and understood. Everyone wants their story heard. **Great HTML is the way to communicate your story to the world.**\n\nWhen I was 14 months old and hungry, I would pull on my mother's pant leg, point to the counter looming over my head, and grunt, \"Cookie.\" (Or so my mother says. I do not remember.) She would respond by giving me fruit, crackers, a bowl of dry Cheerios, or whatever else a 14 month old eats. Not a cookie, no matter hard I tried. Or she'd tell me it was almost dinner time and go away and leave her to finish it.\n\nConsider that your crappy HTML is telling this same story. If your website is nothing but one < div > after another, you're just saying COOKIE COOKIE COOKIE. You're 14 months old, with a limited grasp of vocabulary.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/0fad8710f2.jpg\" width=\"409\" height=\"426\" alt=\"Cartoon  - semantic HTML overwhelmed by divitis\" />\n\n<h3>Telling the wrong story </h3>\n\nSo. How do you convince developers, who just love everything pretty and interactive, that their framing sucks and doesn't work? Their code that sits on top of it works just fine. Framing is SO BORING.\n\nWell, accessibility, of course! It's absolutely critical. Accessibility should start at the beginning. It should always be incorporated in the site. Good accessibility starts with meaningful HTML.\n\nBut -- what the accessibility advocates are doing is not effective to get developer attention. They are, unfortunately, ignored for the most part. \n\nWe've (maybe) gotten (some) busy developers to feel guilty about their bad HTML. But changing it takes effort. Learning what HTML elements are available takes time and research. Time that could be spent learning the latest JavaScript framework.\n\nTime for a new story with new framing.\n\n<h3>#MakeHTMLExcitingAgain</h3>\n\nIf we focus on HTML's syntax, that's not interesting. What's interesting is the meaning conveyed behind the elements. Why choose one element over another? How does that element contribute to the website's story?\n\n30DaysofHTML incorporates the following concepts:\n\n* Focus on the meaning behind the elements. When should something be used or not used? \n\n* Don't overwhelm with all of the edge cases and complexity. Provide just enough information to feel like you know a little bit, and provide links to everything else.\n\n* Identify any misconceptions about the element. HTML looks like English. The < address > element, for example, looks like it's for a postal address. However, it can be used for any contact information associated with an article or website author, including phone numbers, email address, social media links, or even geographic coordinates. Who knew that? That's interesting and fun and different.\n\n* Remove the pretty and interactive, so learners are forced to focus on the scaffolding. We aren't concerned with cross-device presentation or UX or anything else. It's black text on a white page. There's nothing else to do here... by design.\n\n* Encourage application, reflection, and discussion. Not only should there be a little reading, but there should be some examples and problems to try too. Maybe the occasional quiz. Encourage readers to share their work and comment on each other's markup and approaches. Put the discussion on the meaning we're trying to convey.\n\n* And finally, make it fun. Make some fun graphics, throw in a few emojis, use all of the web writing techniques to break up content with headings and lists. Write in a fun and informal style.\n\n<h3>Hook 'em with a hook</h3>\n\n[\"< address > should be used for addresses. You guessed that already. But what kind of addresses, and in what context?\"] (https://jen4web.substack.com/p/address)\n  \n  Draw the reader in. Make them curious. Conflict is interesting. The lure of something that perhaps you don't know is intriguing.\n  \n  I also sent out a [\"Night Before\"] (https://jen4web.substack.com/p/twas-the-night-before-30daysofhtml) email, explaining what to expect and how it will all work. This sets anxious learners at ease, and it sets expectations and generates interest. It also sets metrics for what success looks like.\n  \n  <h3>Give them a familiar format</h3>\n  \n*  The \"X Days\" format is popular at this moment. People talk about #100DaysofCode and #100DaysofNoCode and such. Why not #30DaysofHTML? Fortunately, it explains everything you need to know in the hashtag. 30 days, talking about HTML.\n  \n*  Email is the format for delivery. It's simple, easy, and everyone has it. Using Substack, I also create a website, and it has interesting discussion features for sharing work.\n  \n*  In Silicon Valley speak, \"reduce friction.\" The email goes in your inbox. You read it when you're ready. Another appears tomorrow. You're getting 30 emails in 30 days. What's not to love?\n\n<h3>Time to start!</h3>\n\nThis is the start of my 30 day journey. I hope to learn more about HTML, but mostly, I hope to learn more about offering instruction in this format. What works and what falls flat? What is the response? What would I do differently next time?\n\nI'll write more about this in May.\n  \n",

				"content_text": "This week's reading: [Academics aren’t content creators, and it’s regressive to make them so] (https://www.timeshighereducation.com/opinion/academics-arent-content-creators-and-its-regressive-make-them-so)\n\nA few quick snips from the article:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe philosopher John Dewey told us that an educational experience – what he called a community of inquiry – requires a cognitive presence (the learner), a social presence (the learning community) and a teaching presence (the professor). \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  By Dewey’s definition, if our professors spend their time editing videos instead of engaging with students, we cease to even be “educational” institutions. A video made by a professor for only their class is akin to the single-copy, handwritten book disseminated to just one room of people. It is regression, not progress.\n</blockquote>\n\nI think the argument the author is making is this:\n\n* Dewey says good learning involves 3 elements: learner, learning community, and instructor. This is a virtuous circle. All three elements feed on each other.\n\n* If the instructor must spend more time making (bad) video, they have less time to spend with learners. The video is often bad, because instructors are usually not filmmakers. \"Bad\" may be bad production, but it may also be bad storytelling in the video.\n\n* If the video is bad, then the learners will go elsewhere to get content, fracturing the community.\n\n* Without all three elements in place for a good learning experience, university education is simply overpriced.\n\n<h3>The practical side of this</h3>\n\nI also make a lot of professional video for LinkedIn Learning and Frontend Masters. \n\nIn the past, I've tried to use these videos as the basis for my class. The students were extremely unhappy, because they could get their own subscription for pennies on the dollar of what they were paying for my university course.\n\nThey prefer my less polished, less produced, lower quality video, because they felt this was a better value for their dollar. Why?\n\nBecause they feel connected with me when I make a video for them. Students feel like they know me when I'm being my normal goofy self on camera. I have less of a personality when I'm on camera at LinkedIn. Professional polish and all that.\n\n<h3>Video as textbook and analysis</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  Content can enable learning, but it cannot provide an education. Similarly, content is not our core value. There is a long tradition, going back to the printing press, of universities outsourcing their content provision to the textbook: an expensive relic, now replaced by largely free content on the internet. This is progress. Education should be better than ever, as we are now able to point at myriad incredible resources, possibly on the web, perhaps in our library, where we act as content aggregator, not creator. Creation is done when we have our researcher hats on, not our teaching hats.\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  In the old days, we read the book before we went to class, where the information was discussed and interpreted. \n  \n  Today, video is asked to do both of these things at once: provide the information of the textbook AND provide the discussion and interpretation. The author thinks that professors spending their time making the textbook is a waste. Find other resources online, have the students use these as the textbook, and then provide interpretation and discussion in class.\n  \n  What if we had some type of vetted and reviewed video that we could incorporate in our courses? Then we have an effective textbook for our courses, and again, the professor brings the interpretation and meaning to the material.\n  \n  <h3>But I can't make YouTube-style video, so my stuff isn't engaging!</h3>\n  \n  I don't believe this at all, because the argument here is **the technology should drive the content.** In other words, the students won't watch without music, jump cuts, and crazy graphics.\n  \n  What if we had good content, making a reasonable video that tells a good story but with much less flash?

In this course, instructor Jen Kramer gives you all the tools you need to make those tasks easy. Jen goes over basic links, linking to different files and resources, and linking from images, headers, text, and more. She shows you how you can style links and individual link states using CSS selectors, then goes into how you can make exceptions and create different styles. Jen covers the steps you should take to maintain links and redirect them when necessary.</blockquote>\n  \n  When LinkedIn asked me to put together a course on links, I thought it was a ridiculous idea. How much could be said about links? \n  \n  Then I started spelling out All The Things:\n  \n  * Linking to pages within your site and pages elsewhere on the internet, in new windows/tabs and the same window/tab.\n  \n  * Links to other things: PDFs and other documents, email addresses, phone numbers. \n  \n  * Links within the same document (back to top links, links to sections of the page).\n  \n  * Images as the item to click on to load a link, instead of text. \n  \n  * Image maps, in which one image contains more than one link.\n  \n  * The five states of a link for styling purposes: unvisited, visited, hover, active (once the link is clicked but before the page loads), and focus (when the link is selected but not yet clicked).\n  \n  * Navigation bars, horizontal and vertical.\n  \n  * Styling text links to look like buttons.\n  \n  * Checking for link rot.\n  \n  * Using a robots.txt file to control search engine movement in a site.\n  \n  * Redirects, both client-side (meta tag) and server-side (301, 302, etc).\n  \n  \n  Basically, there's a whole universe of links, and this is the course that covers it all.\n  \n",

When knowledge is locked up in the jargon of a specific discipline, it's not transferable to others. \n\nHow can you make your work accessible to adjacent disciplines? How can you codify what you know into a framework that applies to cousins of your areas of interest?\n\nHonestly, the last thing we need are the 24-year olds who discovered no-code during the pandemic to teach people how to build no-code products. They don't have the background to do it well. \n",

				"content_html": "<p>One of the great outcomes of studying instructional design from a theoretical perspective is the ability to spot patterns in teaching.</p>\n<p>When teaching software and coding, one typically encounters two theories in use.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Behaviorism<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> : Just teach people the behavior and reward them for doing it correctly. Based on B.F. Skinner and others.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Best use is for the fundamentals of the subject. In math, it&rsquo;s basic arithmetic. In languages, it&rsquo;s alphabet, spelling, and grammar. In music, it&rsquo;s notes, rhythms, and scales. If the teacher says &ldquo;you just have to memorize this,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s behaviorism.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re evaluating performance, it&rsquo;s often done through multiple choice, true/false, and other means of regurgitating facts. Students are rewarded for memorizing, not applying.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you were making a recipe, you would be rewarded for following all of the instructions correctly, rather than how good the recipe tastes. Behaviorism does not work in all kinds of learning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Constructivism<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> : &ldquo;Learn by doing.&rdquo; Base your learning on previous experience in the world, and apply that previous learning to the problem at hand.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re following a recipe, you&rsquo;re the person who changes the ingredients the first time you try it. You know what you like and what works from previous cooking experiences. You know you don&rsquo;t like mushrooms, and you&rsquo;ll leave them out of this recipe. You substitute butter for margarine, chicken broth for beef broth, and add meat to vegetarian dishes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Best use is &ldquo;doing&rdquo; subjects once the fundamentals are mastered. Once a music student has learned a piece of music by a Baroque-era composer, how would the student apply those techniques and styles to the next Baroque-era piece she learns?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Evaluation happens through some kind of final product, not through the work along the way. Typically this is a project-based evaluation: a final research paper, a piece of working software, a film, a performance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Constructivism shouldn&rsquo;t be applied where there are absolutely right and wrong answers. It&rsquo;s more about the shades of grey than the extremes of the spectrum.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the software and coding world, behaviorism drives most instruction one encounters. It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;help files&rdquo; associated with the software: go here, click this, type that, and you&rsquo;re done. In code, it&rsquo;s dominated by StackOverflow and developer blogs: here&rsquo;s a chunk of code that does this thing.</p>\n<p>Often, a coding class will start with examination of that chunk of code and some of its nuances. In that moment, students would tell you that they understood that code and its use.</p>\n<p>The next thing students are instructed to do is constructivist. &ldquo;OK, now apply this to your own project.&rdquo; No further guidance is given in that moment.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This critical moment is the time when students decide they are not &ldquo;good&rdquo; at programming or technology.

				"content_text": "One of the great outcomes of studying instructional design from a theoretical perspective is the ability to spot patterns in teaching.\n\nWhen teaching software and coding, one typically encounters two theories in use. \n\n* <strong><a href=\"https://www.wgu.edu/blog/what-behavioral-learning-theory2005.html\" target=\"_blank\">Behaviorism</a></strong> : Just teach people the behavior and reward them for doing it correctly. Based on B.F. Skinner and others. \n \n * Best use is for the fundamentals of the subject. In math, it's basic arithmetic. In languages, it's alphabet, spelling, and grammar. In music, it's notes, rhythms, and scales. If the teacher says \"you just have to memorize this,\" that's behaviorism.\n \n * If you're evaluating performance, it's often done through multiple choice, true/false, and other means of regurgitating facts. Students are rewarded for memorizing, not applying.\n \n * If you were making a recipe, you would be rewarded for following all of the instructions correctly, rather than how good the recipe tastes. Behaviorism does not work in all kinds of learning.\n\n\n* <strong><a href=\"https://www.wgu.edu/blog/what-constructivism2005.html\" target=\"_blank\">Constructivism</a></strong> : \"Learn by doing.\" Base your learning on previous experience in the world, and apply that previous learning to the problem at hand. \n\n * If you're following a recipe, you're the person who changes the ingredients the first time you try it. You know what you like and what works from previous cooking experiences. You know you don't like mushrooms, and you'll leave them out of this recipe. You substitute butter for margarine, chicken broth for beef broth, and add meat to vegetarian dishes.\n \n  * Best use is \"doing\" subjects once the fundamentals are mastered. Once a music student has learned a piece of music by a Baroque-era composer, how would the student apply those techniques and styles to the next Baroque-era piece she learns?\n\n * Evaluation happens through some kind of final product, not through the work along the way. Typically this is a project-based evaluation: a final research paper, a piece of working software, a film, a performance.\n \n * Constructivism shouldn't be applied where there are absolutely right and wrong answers. It's more about the shades of grey than the extremes of the spectrum.\n\nIn the software and coding world, behaviorism drives most instruction one encounters. It's the \"help files\" associated with the software: go here, click this, type that, and you're done. In code, it's dominated by StackOverflow and developer blogs: here's a chunk of code that does this thing.\n\nOften, a coding class will start with examination of that chunk of code and some of its nuances. In that moment, students would tell you that they understood that code and its use.\n\nThe next thing students are instructed to do is constructivist. \"OK, now apply this to your own project.\" No further guidance is given in that moment. \n\n<strong>This critical moment is the time when students decide they are not \"good\" at programming or technology.  Instead, these students are a victim of poor teaching. </strong>\n\nThe instruction isn't necessarily bad. The instructor explained that code in minute detail. The idea of applying that code to your own project isn't bad either. Unfortunately, there's a step missing in between.\n\nThat step is [transference] (https://learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/288/can-they-do-it-in-the-real-world-designing-for-transfer-of-learning). This is the moment you take a concept you learned in one context and apply it to the next problem. It's really, really hard to do.\n\nMost people experienced this in grade school in math class.

Word problems required you to read a few sentences, identify the problem that needed to be solved, identify the math to solve it, and calculate the answer. Most students did fine with basic arithmetic and failed miserably with word problems. \n\nProfessional software engineers are very good at transference. Instructors are really good at it too. However, the majority of students need help in making the leap from one context to the other. \n\n[There are techniques that assist with transference] (https://learnnocode.dev/2020/12/27/the-fundamental-formula.html).

Harvard&rsquo;s digital media capstone projects are all over the map: films, courses, websites,  UX projects, and combinations of these.</p>\n<p>It is impossible to structure grading for a capstone project for this reason. However, structured grading is most vital for this course among all others.</p>\n<p>In every other university course, grading happens during the term in some way through periodic assignments. Even in courses with a heavy assignment at end of the course, students still have some concept of how they&rsquo;re doing as they complete their final work.</p>\n<p>However, a capstone should be evaluated as a complete work, rather than evaluated piecemeal through the term. While students should get feedback along the way, they shouldn&rsquo;t receive a hard grade until the end. They should have the opportunity to refine all deliverables and aspects of the project in light of whatever they&rsquo;re currently creating. The point of capstone is to bring together multiple aspects of the degree program and synthesize learning over the curriculum. Grading, therefore, needs to be at the end and encompass the full project.</p>\n<p>This clearly leads to potential issues. What happens when the student thinks they&rsquo;ve done A work, but the instructor thinks it&rsquo;s a C-? What happens when the student&rsquo;s project isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;weighty&rdquo; enough for a capstone? These potential surprises (risks!) must be mitigated in some way.</p>\n<p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned in a previous post, students don&rsquo;t understand mitigating risk going into capstone, nor do they understand how to scope a project. We also have an issue of how to grade a unique project.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, a student-written grading rubric solves all of these issues.</p>\n<p>I review their rubric and make sure the bar isn&rsquo;t set low or that they&rsquo;re working on trivial things. But have faith in these adult students. They chose to go to grad school with a reason in mind. Most want to do well on their project, but they also want to learn something new and be proud of their work. With guidance, they write a challenging rubric that stretches them, but not too far so it&rsquo;s still achievable within the semester timeline.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s go through all of the learning that happens when students write their own grading rubrics.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"rubrics-identify-deliverables-and-completion-timelines\">Rubrics identify deliverables and completion timelines</h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m creating a 15-minute documentary on X topic.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s another to spell out exactly what it takes to create that: storyboarding, running the interviews, choosing the B-roll and music, editing it together.</p>\n<p>Larger deliverables may be broken down further. For example, an interview segment might be graded according to lighting, camera angle and focus, sound quality, color correction, how it furthers the story, and consistency of these characteristics across interview segments.</p>\n<p>Most students also put together a timeline for their work along with this list. I encourage them to create milestones, so they can quickly measure if they&rsquo;re on track, behind, or ahead of schedule.</p>\n<p>When students write down all of the elements and stages they must complete to create their project, and particularly once they schedule these over the semester, they start to get a sense of scope. They realize whether they&rsquo;ve committed to too much work and need to scale it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rubrics-determine-how-work-should-be-weighted-and-graded\">Rubrics determine how work should be weighted and graded</h3>\n<p>Once students have completed their list of deliverables, the next question is how to grade each deliverable.</p>\n<p>There are two parts to this question. First, how do we evaluate each deliverable? Second, not all deliverables are created equal, so where should we place grading emphasis, and what should be minimized?</p>\n<h4 id=\"grading\">Grading</h4>\n<p>My students and I have conversations about how to communicate grading so that we&rsquo;re both on the same page. <strong>How do you define good quality in a rubric so it&rsquo;s clear enough to hang your grade on it?</strong></p>\n<p>Still, my favorite rubric item shows up over and over, year after year: <em>&ldquo;The website will be simple and easy to use.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>A noble goal! But how do we measure that? What is simple and easy for you may not be for me. This is usually where I ask the student if they will do user testing to ensure the site is simple and easy to use. And if the testers show that it&rsquo;s not, what will they do then? (Usually this is sufficent to convince them to refine this criterion in some way to reflect the intent, but in a more measurable way.)</p>\n<p>Students struggle with quality metrics in rubrics, but in the end, it&rsquo;s a good exercise. It&rsquo;s part of learning clear communication. It&rsquo;s also useful for the end of the course, when they&rsquo;re running out of time and they&rsquo;re paralyzed by whether something is &ldquo;good enough.&rdquo; Since they made the decision of how to measure their work up front, allocating their time is an easier decision.</p>\n<h4 id=\"weighting\">Weighting</h4>\n<p>Some deliverables are more important than others. Some should be completed at a different level than others.</p>\n<p>If a student is creating a documentary as their main focus, and they want to also complete a website for that documentary, I think that&rsquo;s great. But the website is a minor deliverable. It might be built with Squarespace or other no-code technology.</p>\n<p>If a student is creating a website as their main focus, however, it&rsquo;s not going to be built in Squarespace, and it will involve some level of coding.</p>\n<p>Within a deliverable, elements may be weighted differently as well. With websites, for example, some students want to emphasize graphic design, or page performance, or writing some type of code, or usability. All of these are important to the site, but not all need to be emphasized in the capstone project with a limited timeline. An ugly website with innovative coding may be as legitimate a project as a website with breathtaking graphics and photos and less coding.</p>\n<p>Students should have some say in what they consider important (and presumably where they want to spend their time), vs. what they consider less important. I ask students to reflect on their learning goals for this project, in addition to the amount of time required for each deliverable. Those that take more time might be worth more points. There may be some &ldquo;stretch deliverables&rdquo; that the student isn&rsquo;t confident they can reach, but they don&rsquo;t want to jeopardize their grade or graduation. These might be weighted less to help mitigate risk.</p>\n<p>Likewise, when students identify trivial deliverables (&ldquo;navigation will work on all pages of the website&rdquo;), I gently point out if they have not mastered navigation bars prior to enrolling in capstone, they are not qualified to build a website as a capstone project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rubrics-for-time-management\">Rubrics for time management</h3>\n<p>In the last 4 weeks of the semester, as the students are in their final grind to complete their projects, inevitably some level of panic sets in. Some deliverables took longer than expected. Work was demanding. Home life is demanding, particularly in pandemic times. Life happened along the way.</p>\n<p>I remember when one student discovered a new technique for coding his project in these final weeks. He asked if he needed to refactor his project to use the technique. I asked what was on his rubric. Since neither the technique nor refactoring was listed as a deliverable, he understood he should keep going with what he had. Refactoring could be done after capstone.</p>\n<p>Other students are short on time but long on deliverables towards the end. I advise working on deliverables with heavier weighting. They can also decide what&rsquo;s faster and easier to complete and concentrate efforts there.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rubrics-for-organizing-deliverables\">Rubrics for organizing deliverables</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my film!&rdquo; Great! Now what?</p>\n<p>I have students use their rubric as an organization tool for their deliverables. Where should I look for proof of excellence in each criterion?</p>\n<p>Not all deliverables are contained within the main project (film, website, course). For example, a storyboard is critical to the film, but it&rsquo;s a separate deliverable from the film. Many website and course deliverables also follow this pattern.</p>\n<p>Rather than being forced to hunt for All The Things, students choose where I look. Time stamps, website addresses, lines of code, Word documents, and more form the basis of deliverables.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rubrics-for-reflection\">Rubrics for reflection</h3>\n<p>Finally, students fill out their own grading rubric as part of the reflection process. (I also ask them to write a final blog post reflecting on what went well and what they&rsquo;d do differently next time.)</p>\n<p>When students grade themselves, they are required to compare their work with the measurements they set. Did they achieve these metrics? Why or why not?</p>\n<p>In most instances, students gave themselves lower marks than I did, sometimes dramatically so. The rest of the time, I agreed with their assessment. I can only think of one instance where my grade was lower than the student&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p>Many students start this grading and reflection exercise with an eye roll, believing it&rsquo;s the final busy-work hurdle to graduation. But I don&rsquo;t give busy work. By the time they&rsquo;re done, they usually comment on how useful the reflection process was.</p>\n<p>Whew, that&rsquo;s a lot for one grading rubric. If you wind up with capstone students, I strongly recommend trying it with your next cohort.</p>\n",

They realize whether they've committed to too much work and need to scale it. \n\n### Rubrics determine how work should be weighted and graded\n\nOnce students have completed their list of deliverables, the next question is how to grade each deliverable. \n\nThere are two parts to this question. First, how do we evaluate each deliverable? Second, not all deliverables are created equal, so where should we place grading emphasis, and what should be minimized?\n\n#### Grading\n\nMy students and I have conversations about how to communicate grading so that we're both on the same page. **How do you define good quality in a rubric so it's clear enough to hang your grade on it?**\n\nStill, my favorite rubric item shows up over and over, year after year: *\"The website will be simple and easy to use.\"*\n\nA noble goal! But how do we measure that? What is simple and easy for you may not be for me. This is usually where I ask the student if they will do user testing to ensure the site is simple and easy to use. And if the testers show that it's not, what will they do then? (Usually this is sufficent to convince them to refine this criterion in some way to reflect the intent, but in a more measurable way.)\n\nStudents struggle with quality metrics in rubrics, but in the end, it's a good exercise. It's part of learning clear communication. It's also useful for the end of the course, when they're running out of time and they're paralyzed by whether something is \"good enough.\" Since they made the decision of how to measure their work up front, allocating their time is an easier decision.\n\n#### Weighting\n\nSome deliverables are more important than others. Some should be completed at a different level than others.\n\nIf a student is creating a documentary as their main focus, and they want to also complete a website for that documentary, I think that's great. But the website is a minor deliverable. It might be built with Squarespace or other no-code technology.\n\nIf a student is creating a website as their main focus, however, it's not going to be built in Squarespace, and it will involve some level of coding.\n\nWithin a deliverable, elements may be weighted differently as well. With websites, for example, some students want to emphasize graphic design, or page performance, or writing some type of code, or usability. All of these are important to the site, but not all need to be emphasized in the capstone project with a limited timeline. An ugly website with innovative coding may be as legitimate a project as a website with breathtaking graphics and photos and less coding.\n\nStudents should have some say in what they consider important (and presumably where they want to spend their time), vs. what they consider less important. I ask students to reflect on their learning goals for this project, in addition to the amount of time required for each deliverable. Those that take more time might be worth more points. There may be some \"stretch deliverables\" that the student isn't confident they can reach, but they don't want to jeopardize their grade or graduation. These might be weighted less to help mitigate risk.\n\nLikewise, when students identify trivial deliverables (\"navigation will work on all pages of the website\"), I gently point out if they have not mastered navigation bars prior to enrolling in capstone, they are not qualified to build a website as a capstone project.\n\n### Rubrics for time management\n\nIn the last 4 weeks of the semester, as the students are in their final grind to complete their projects, inevitably some level of panic sets in. Some deliverables took longer than expected. Work was demanding. Home life is demanding, particularly in pandemic times. Life happened along the way.\n\nI remember when one student discovered a new technique for coding his project in these final weeks. He asked if he needed to refactor his project to use the technique. I asked what was on his rubric. Since neither the technique nor refactoring was listed as a deliverable, he understood he should keep going with what he had. Refactoring could be done after capstone.\n\nOther students are short on time but long on deliverables towards the end. I advise working on deliverables with heavier weighting. They can also decide what's faster and easier to complete and concentrate efforts there.\n\n### Rubrics for organizing deliverables\n\n\"Here's my film!\" Great! Now what? \n\nI have students use their rubric as an organization tool for their deliverables. Where should I look for proof of excellence in each criterion?\n\nNot all deliverables are contained within the main project (film, website, course). For example, a storyboard is critical to the film, but it's a separate deliverable from the film. Many website and course deliverables also follow this pattern.\n\nRather than being forced to hunt for All The Things, students choose where I look. Time stamps, website addresses, lines of code, Word documents, and more form the basis of deliverables.\n\n### Rubrics for reflection\n\nFinally, students fill out their own grading rubric as part of the reflection process. (I also ask them to write a final blog post reflecting on what went well and what they'd do differently next time.)\n\nWhen students grade themselves, they are required to compare their work with the measurements they set. Did they achieve these metrics? Why or why not? \n\nIn most instances, students gave themselves lower marks than I did, sometimes dramatically so. The rest of the time, I agreed with their assessment. I can only think of one instance where my grade was lower than the student's. \n\nMany students start this grading and reflection exercise with an eye roll, believing it's the final busy-work hurdle to graduation. But I don't give busy work. By the time they're done, they usually comment on how useful the reflection process was. \n\nWhew, that's a lot for one grading rubric. If you wind up with capstone students, I strongly recommend trying it with your next cohort.\n\n",

Others went to grad school to \"learn more about computers.\" \n\nWhen it came time for capstone, everything changed. The style of teaching, the expectations of students and instructors, the work, the overwhelm, the self-doubt, and the joy of completion were always part of the journey.\n\nOver the next several posts, I will identify a few common themes that ran through nearly every capston project I advised. We'll start here, with one of my favorite capstone cartoons. Every student experienced this somewhere along the way.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/673f737d90.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"508\" alt=\"\" />\n",

I don't need a site builder for my own websites.\n\nEven though my previous site was built with just HTML, CSS, and PHP includes, it was still annoying to update. Weeding through the code just to find the text I wanted was an extra level of thought that, honestly, wasn't required.\n\nA redesign was overwhelming to think about. Beyond color schemes, fonts, photos, and content, there are infinite ways to manage the layout.\n\nSoftr removes all of those variables so I can focus on exactly what I want to say and how I want to say it.\n\nIt's a dynamic wireframe in real time. I can run this site without worrying about all of the cross-browser testing, design, and technical details I'd normally manage. Here I can focus on the flow of the site, the content presented, and the order of information.\n\nI've based this site model on [Donald Miller's Storybrand wireframe tips] (https://buildingastorybrand.com/lay-out-an-effective-home-page/).

				"content_html": "<p>In non-pandemic times, I speak at a lot of conferences. While there, I attend talks.</p>\n<p>There are two ways to look at every talk at a conference.</p>\n<p><strong>a. It is adding on to a topic or area that you already know well.</strong> As a CSS expert, any CSS talks usually fall in this category for me.</p>\n<p><strong>b. You know nothing about the topic, but you&rsquo;ve heard about it peripherally and have some curiosity in this area.</strong> I&rsquo;m not a JavaScript expert. However, I&rsquo;m curious about what problems the latest JavaScript framework addresses. What are the advantages of React over Vue? Vue over React? Why do we need all of these frameworks anyway?</p>\n<p>In the first 3-5 minutes of your talk, you can satisfy both of these audiences quickly and easily by grounding the audience in the technology you&rsquo;re presenting.</p>\n<p>Amazing! How do you do it?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>&ldquo;The technology I&rsquo;m talking about today is Y. Y is {type of technology} that addresses ABC problems. It&rsquo;s put out by JKL Corporation/open source project/whatever, under a DEF license. It requires GHI technologies to configure and run.&rdquo; (describe dependencies, technology stack, or server configurations here)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&ldquo;Y solves the following types of problems&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&ldquo;You may wonder why we need Y, when we already have X, which addresses the same problems.  X and Y are indeed similar, so let&rsquo;s compare their strengths and weaknesses.&rdquo;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s get into the meat of Y.&rdquo; (Time to go geeky wild!!!)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This formula conveys all kinds of background information about your technology very quickly. In 5 minutes, as a geeky person fluent in web technologies, I&rsquo;ve got all of the high-level details I need to decide if Y is any interest to me at all. That is an excellent talk already. Five stars!</p>\n<p>What if you already know X? Well, in 5 minutes, you may still pick up a nugget you didn&rsquo;t know before, or make a connection you hadn&rsquo;t previously made. For example, when you look at strengths and weaknesses of various technologies, you may not have been able to articulate why you&rsquo;re so excited about Y to your boss. Now you have the argument to do it.</p>\n<p>By the way, the <strong>true experts</strong> in technology never mind these high level discussions or think less of you for giving them. Everyone must learn sometime. If you can explain a technology in 5 minutes, that&rsquo;s mastery in action.</p>\n<p>The next time you give a talk, internally at your company or externally at a conference, keep these points in mind.</p>\n<p><strong>You don&rsquo;t have to be comprehensive in your presentation.

				"content_text": "In non-pandemic times, I speak at a lot of conferences. While there, I attend talks. \n\nThere are two ways to look at every talk at a conference. \n\n**a. It is adding on to a topic or area that you already know well.** As a CSS expert, any CSS talks usually fall in this category for me. \n\n**b. You know nothing about the topic, but you've heard about it peripherally and have some curiosity in this area.** I'm not a JavaScript expert. However, I'm curious about what problems the latest JavaScript framework addresses. What are the advantages of React over Vue? Vue over React? Why do we need all of these frameworks anyway?\n\nIn the first 3-5 minutes of your talk, you can satisfy both of these audiences quickly and easily by grounding the audience in the technology you're presenting.\n\nAmazing! How do you do it?\n\n1. \"The technology I'm talking about today is Y. Y is {type of technology} that addresses ABC problems. It's put out by JKL Corporation/open source project/whatever, under a DEF license. It requires GHI technologies to configure and run.\" (describe dependencies, technology stack, or server configurations here)\n\n2. \"Y solves the following types of problems...\"\n\n3. \"You may wonder why we need Y, when we already have X, which addresses the same problems.  X and Y are indeed similar, so let's compare their strengths and weaknesses.\"\n\n4. \"Now let's get into the meat of Y.\" (Time to go geeky wild!!!)\n\nThis formula conveys all kinds of background information about your technology very quickly. In 5 minutes, as a geeky person fluent in web technologies, I've got all of the high-level details I need to decide if Y is any interest to me at all. That is an excellent talk already. Five stars!\n\nWhat if you already know X? Well, in 5 minutes, you may still pick up a nugget you didn't know before, or make a connection you hadn't previously made. For example, when you look at strengths and weaknesses of various technologies, you may not have been able to articulate why you're so excited about Y to your boss. Now you have the argument to do it.\n\nBy the way, the **true experts** in technology never mind these high level discussions or think less of you for giving them. Everyone must learn sometime. If you can explain a technology in 5 minutes, that's mastery in action. \n\nThe next time you give a talk, internally at your company or externally at a conference, keep these points in mind. \n\n**You don't have to be comprehensive in your presentation. You need to be memorable.**\n\nAnd being comprehensive means you're not memorable.\n\nPresent so the audience learns and remembers, not like a specification. We can always look up the specification later.\n",

				"content_text": "The state of jenkramer.org is pretty horrible.\n\nI redesigned this site in 2014 using Bootstrap 3, LESS for styling, and PHP includes. \n\nYou might be wondering why I chose those technologies, of all of the technologies that were out there. \n\na. Keep in mind that while 2014 was only 7 years minus one week ago, **the web has changed radically since then.** \n\n<ul>\n  <li>The initial React release was in mid-2013. Angular was in 2016. We were in a period of \"framework flavor of the month\" at this point. Every conference seemed to have people desperate to dominate the next big thing in JavaScript. There were a lot of things coming out then.</li>\n\n<li><strong>jQuery was still very much a thing in 2014.</strong> jQuery Mobile was starting to decline with the availability (and superior responsive design) of Bootstrap. jQuery UI wasn't responsive and was declining as well, plus Bootstrap had its own UI components.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Bootstrap was a massive game-changer on the front-end.</strong> In 2014, people were only starting to transition to Flexbox for layouts from floats. People don't understand floats for layout. And people definitely don't understand CSS. Responsive design was still a mystery to many people, particularly how to code it by hand. And Bootstrap was HUGE in the bootcamps, which were thriving by this point. Indeed, that's often how CSS was taught: Here's Bootstrap. Use it.</li>\n\n<li>Grunt might have been a thing, with Gulp gaining traction. Webpack didn't exist. Node was out there, but only just getting started. </li>\n\n  <li>This sounds like my web stories from 20 years ago. <strong>Keep in mind it's only been SEVEN YEARS. </strong></li>\n  </ul>\n\nb. <strong>Bootstrap only integrated with LESS at this point.</strong> Sass integration was coming, but not for a while.\n\nc. OK, PHP includes were old, even then. But they are super easy to configure, and they gave me some simple moving parts for repeated content on the site to make maintenance easier. <strong>Technology doesn't have to hurt to work, people.</strong>\n\nd. It's only a 10 page website. I wasn't blogging. I wasn't trying to sell anything. No one was maintaining the site but me. I could have installed WordPress, but then I'd have to maintain it. **There wasn't any real reason to build anything but a static site.**\n\n\n\n\n## Redesign time\n\nSo why does one need to redesign?\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The technology driving the site is old and dated. It's too hard to maintain, or it's a security threat. </strong><br>\nWell... yeah, OK, Bootstrap 3 is old, and so are PHP includes. But nothing is a security threat here, and I don't mind writing HTML to update content. Basically, I'm \"meh\" on my tech stack, as long as the site is telling a good story. Honestly, I don't need to take hours to set up a development environment, or installing things, or figuring out why X in the stack isn't working. I don't have time for that. It's a simple website.</li>\n\n<li><strong>The content is dated and needs revising.</strong><br>\nTHIS is the reason the site needs a redesign. There's waaaaay too much blah blah on the site. Nothing is focused. It's all over the place, trying to be comprehensive. So time to focus the story.</li>\n\n## Focusing the story\n\nI have a lot of writing to do before I'm ready to redesign completely. Honestly, this is a separate post to explain what I'm doing and why.\n\nBut let's just say it's this, in a nutshell:\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>Cut the blah blah in half, or three-quarters.</li>\n\n<li>More showing, less telling.</li>\n\n<li>Use Donald Miller's Storybrand principles to drive layout.</li>\n\n<li>Reframe the site to the customer as hero, rather than I'm the hero. (Also Donald Miller.)</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  \n  \n## The Plan\n\nSince I'm pivoting to the no-code world (probably another story elsewhere), I'm going to try out a bunch of no-code tools to see what I can learn and create in those environments. \n\nI'll try creating something once a week as possible.\n\nI'll post the results here, along with a review.\n\nThese might not be the final versions of my site. Indeed, they're probably not. But they're a great way to try out the products, identify positives and negatives of each, and decide what I want to do going forward.\n",
